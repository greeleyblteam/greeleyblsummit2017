His School on FIRE (Framework of Innovation for Reinventing Education) model is currently in it's sixth full year of implementation and is seeing dramatic results. Dr. Berry is in his 8th year as Superintendent of Eminence Independent Schools and his team’s success has allowed him to be invited to the White House twice, the first as one of the 100 top school Superintendents in America at their only National Connected Superintendents Summit. Dr. Berry’s work and school district has also been the focus of numerous media and news stories including being recently filmed by Edutopia (George Lucas Films) for several upcoming video series.
