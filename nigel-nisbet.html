                    	<p>With a degree in mathematics and experiences as a rock musician with several international hit songs, Nigel Nisbet began his education career by teaching at an idyllic private girls school in rural England.
											</p>
											<p>After moving to the U.S., he taught Mathematics, AP Physics and Computer Science at Van Nuys Sr. High, where he pioneered blended and project-based learning. He spearheaded the implementation of the Los Angeles Virtual Academy program for Algebra 1, and the AP Readiness Program in Computer Science.  In 2006, he became the Mathematics Specialist for the Los Angeles Unified School District.  While there, he designed and delivered PD, and implemented the transition to RTI programming. He has written, designed and implemented several instructional guides and curriculum.</p>
                    	<p>Passionate about the power of all students to learn mathematics conceptually, he joined the nonprofit MIND Research Institute team in 2010, and is now Vice President of Content Creation.  He and his team reach into the structure and beauty of mathematics, finding ways to build engaging, completely visual games that teach students how math really works—alongside some unique blending learning approaches.  Nigel also travels the country and speaks on such topics as “STEM is a State of MIND” and “The Geometry of Chocolate.” He knows there is much work yet to do, but given his experience working with children in different parts of the world, he believes that given the right tools, all students can be mathematical problem solvers.</p>
                    	<p>Nigel received a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics at Queen Mary University, University of London in 1990. In 2009, he received a Masters in Educational Administration at California State University Northridge.</p>
